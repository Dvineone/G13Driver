# G13Driver

Description:
  This device has no driver support for Linux and Logitech has no plans on creating one. So i decided to develop one myself. This driver is has basic functionality 
allowing the G-Keys to be mapped to keyboard inputs. The Mappings are hard coded ATM but I have plans to implement functionality so this can be read in from a config file.

TODOS:
  Implement functionality for custom G-Key mapping via a configuration file.
  Implement functionality for Joystick mapping.
  Implement functionality for Joystick buttons.
  Implement functionality for LCD ouput. Adding Custom images to LCD display
  Implement functionality for Profiles
  Implement functionality for Macro Recording
  Implement functionality for G-Key Macro execution
